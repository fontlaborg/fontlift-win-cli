# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We dedicate this project to a welcoming, harassment-free collaboration space. Everyone -- maintainers, contributors, and users -- should feel respected when engaging with fontlift-win-cli.

## Our Standards
Behaviours that foster a positive community include:
- Offering constructive feedback and accepting it in good faith.
- Keeping discussions focused on the Windows font CLI scope.
- Respecting differing technical opinions and experience levels.
- Showing empathy when decisions or trade-offs are tough.

Unacceptable behaviour includes:
- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks in any channel.
- Publishing other people's private information without permission.
- Disruptive trolling or deliberate derailment of technical conversations.
- Repeatedly pushing features outside the documented project scope.

## Scope
This policy applies to all project spaces: repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, social channels, and direct communications that reference the project.

## Enforcement
Report incidents to the maintainers at conduct@fontlab.org, including links, context, and timestamps where possible. Maintainers must review reports promptly, keep reporters' details confidential, and respond with a resolution or next steps.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Maintainers may take actions they deem appropriate for the situation, including:
- Verbal or written warning.
- Temporary moderation, such as muted threads or limited access.
- Permanent bans from project spaces in severe or repeated cases.

## Attribution
This policy is adapted from the Contributor Covenant (v2.1) at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/, simplified to match the needs of fontlift-win-cli.
