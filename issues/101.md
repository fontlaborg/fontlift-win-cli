Analyze the entire codebase. Then /plan the tasks: (1) implement semantic versioning of the code based on git tags (`vX.Y.Z`), (2) ensure that we have Github Actions which utilize appropriately adapted `./build.cmd` and `./publish.cmd`. Those build and publish scripts must work in both local environment and on Github Actions, and must support the semver (3) ensure that we have Github Actions which, upon giving a new semver tag (`vX.Y.Z`) produces proper binary distributables and cuts a Github Release with the appropriate artefacts. Once you have planned these tasks in detail and specificity into @PLAN.md , also adjust @TODO.md and then /work on implementing everything. /test regularly and iterate until the implementation is solid and perfect. Make sure to test the Github Actions deployments as well!
