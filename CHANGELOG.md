# CHANGELOG.md
<!-- this_file: CHANGELOG.md -->

All notable changes to fontlift-win-cli will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Documentation Cleanup (2025-11-02)
- **Streamlined documentation:** Aggressively reduced verbose files
  - WORK.md: 102→44 lines (57% reduction) - removed completed task details
  - PLAN.md: 570→90 lines (84% reduction) - removed verbose implementation details
  - TODO.md: Consolidated and focused on actionable items
  - Removed 4 unnecessary LLM-specific files (AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, LLXPRT.md, QWEN.md) - saved 88KB
- **Package Distribution Plan:** Created comprehensive plan for Chocolatey and WinGet distribution
  - Chocolatey: .nuspec manifest, install/uninstall scripts, automated publishing workflow
  - WinGet: Multi-file manifest structure, submission process, update workflow
  - Timeline: 4-week rollout plan

### CI/CD Fix #12 (2025-11-02)
- **Fixed GitHub Actions workflow exit code handling**
  - **Issue:** Test step ran fontlift.exe (exit code 1 for usage), verified success, but didn't reset exit code
  - **Impact:** All CI builds failed even though build and executable test passed
  - **Solution:** Added `exit /b 0` after successful test verification
  - **File changed:** `.github/workflows/build.yml` (line 76)

### Planned for v1.1.25
- Verify CI/CD build passes on Windows runners
- Test Chocolatey and WinGet package creation
- Execute package distribution plan

## [1.1.20] - 2025-11-02

### Fixed
- **CI/CD Fix #9**: Fixed batch file delayed expansion issues (THE TRUE FIX)
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Variables set inside IF blocks weren't expanded correctly without delayed expansion
  - **Impact**: "not was unexpected at this time" errors in both build and release workflows
  - **Solution 1**: Added `setlocal enabledelayedexpansion` at the top of build.cmd and publish.cmd
  - **Solution 2**: Changed all `%VAR%` to `!VAR!` for proper delayed variable expansion
  - **Solution 3**: Replaced `if not exist dir (mkdir dir)` with `md dir 2>nul` to eliminate IF block parsing
  - **Benefits**: Proper variable expansion, no batch parsing errors, more reliable builds
  - Files changed: `build.cmd`, `publish.cmd`
  - **Note**: This completes the fixes started in #6, #7, and #8

## [1.1.17] - 2025-11-02

### Fixed
- **CI/CD Fix #8**: Fixed batch file syntax and added ultimate fallback mechanisms
  - **Issue 1 - Batch Syntax**: `if not exist build mkdir build` caused "not was unexpected at this time" error
  - **Issue 2 - Parameter Validation**: get-version.ps1 didn't validate whitespace-only strings
  - **Issue 3 - No Ultimate Fallback**: No hardcoded constant as absolute last resort
  - **Solution 1**: Changed to `if not exist build (mkdir build)` with explicit parentheses
  - **Solution 2**: Added `IsNullOrWhiteSpace` check and try-catch wrapper with fallback
  - **Solution 3**: Added `ULTIMATE_FALLBACK_*` constants (0.0.0-unknown) in both build scripts
  - **Benefits**: 6-level fallback chain, builds NEVER fail on version issues, explicit warnings
  - Files changed: `build.cmd`, `publish.cmd`, `scripts/get-version.ps1`

## [1.1.13] - 2025-11-02

### Fixed
- **CI/CD Fix #6**: Fixed GitHub Actions environment variable and batch syntax issues
  - **Issue 1 - Batch Syntax**: build.cmd:59 `if not exist "build" mkdir "build"` caused "not was unexpected at this time" error
  - **Issue 2 - Environment Variable**: release.yml used unreliable `GITHUB_REF_NAME` causing "Version string cannot be empty" error
  - **Solution 1**: Changed to `if not exist build mkdir build` (removed quotes - standard batch idiom)
  - **Solution 2**: Changed to use `GITHUB_REF` with regex extraction `^refs/tags/v?(.+)$` (always available)
  - **Benefits**: Reliable batch parsing, robust tag version extraction, added debug output
  - Files changed: `build.cmd` (line 59), `.github/workflows/release.yml` (lines 26-46)
- **CI/CD Fix #5** (2025-11-02): Fixed batch file special character handling for SemVer build metadata
  - **Root Cause**: The `+` character in build metadata (e.g., `1.1.10-dev.1+g9c501b5`) caused "not was unexpected at this time" error when passed through batch file `call` command
  - **Impact**: CI builds failed when git-generated versions included build metadata (+commit-sha)
  - **Solution**: Modified `build.cmd` line 62 to invoke PowerShell directly instead of through batch wrapper
  - **Benefits**: Handles all valid SemVer strings, more reliable, simpler call chain
  - File changed: `build.cmd` (line 62)
- **CI/CD Fix #4** (2025-11-02): Fixed double version resolution bug in `build.cmd` and `publish.cmd`
  - **Root Cause**: Batch scripts were calling `get-version.cmd` a second time even when version was passed as argument from GitHub Actions
  - **Impact**: PowerShell invocations failed with "Version string cannot be empty" error
  - **Solution**: Modified batch files to use argument directly when provided, only calling `get-version.cmd` when no argument given
  - **Benefits**: Eliminates redundant script calls, faster builds, more robust CI/CD pipeline
  - Files changed: `build.cmd` (lines 18-46), `publish.cmd` (lines 17-45)

### Changes in v1.1.4-v1.1.9 (Multiple Release Attempts)
- **CI/CD Update** (2025-11-02): Replaced legacy batch parsing with PowerShell helpers
  - New scripts: `scripts/get-version.ps1` and `scripts/generate-version-rc.ps1`
  - Provides accurate SemVer derivation from git tags, including pre-release/build metadata
  - Eliminates batch script syntax errors in version handling
  - Exposes `VERSION_BASE`, `VERSION_SEMVER`, and `VERSION_TAG` to workflows
- **PowerShell Compatibility** (2025-11-02): Renamed helper parameters to `-TargetVersion`
  - Avoids conflict with PowerShell host `-Version` switch
- **Workflow Alignment** (2025-11-02): Updated GitHub Actions workflows
  - Build and release workflows now use PowerShell for version resolution
  - Improved error handling and validation

### Maintenance
- 2025-11-01: Ran `/report` workflow; local tests blocked because `build.cmd` requires Windows tooling (non-Windows environment).
- 2025-11-02: `/test` workflow failed — `uvx hatch test` reports `file or directory not found: tests`; no automated test suite exists yet.

### Documentation
- 2025-11-02: Refreshed `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` with `this_file` metadata and streamlined review checklist.
- 2025-11-02: Added `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` derived from Contributor Covenant v2.1 with project-specific enforcement notes.
- 2025-11-02: Created `docs/test-fonts.md` and linked from README, documenting recommended OFL-licensed fonts for regression tests.

## [1.1.3] - 2025-11-01 (Release Failed - No Assets)

### Known Issues
- **CI/CD Failure**: Release workflow failed during build step
  - Root cause: `echo|set /p` in get-version.cmd incompatible with PowerShell
  - Impact: No binary assets published for this release
  - Fix: Planned for v1.1.4

### Bug Fixes Attempted
- **GitHub Actions Fix #1** (2025-11-01): Fixed batch script syntax error in `scripts/generate-version-rc.cmd`
  - Error: "not was unexpected at this time" causing all CI/CD workflows to fail
  - Root cause: Incorrect use of `%VAR%` instead of `!VAR!` within `setlocal enabledelayedexpansion` block
  - Fixed lines 38, 39, 44, 51, 53 to use delayed expansion syntax: `!INPUT!`, `!OUTPUT!`, etc.
  - Result: Partial success - generate-version-rc.cmd now works, but get-version.cmd still fails
- Multiple iterations attempting to fix version extraction workflow
  - Switched from cmd to PowerShell for version extraction
  - Added version trimming logic
  - Issue persisted due to `echo|set /p` technique

### New Features (v1.1.1)
- **List Command Enhancement**: Added `-s` flag for sorted and unique output
  - `fontlift list -s` - Sort output alphabetically and remove duplicates
  - Works with all combinations: `-s`, `-p -s`, `-n -s`, `-n -p -s`
  - Uses std::set for automatic sorting and deduplication
  - Clean pipe-friendly output (no prolog/epilog)

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `<set>` and `<algorithm>` includes to font_ops.cpp
- Modified `ListFonts()` signature to accept `sorted` parameter
- Collect output in `std::set<std::string>` when sorted flag is true
- Output sorted results after enumeration completes
- 15 lines of code added, all functions remain <20 lines

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-01

### Planning & Research (2025-10-31)
- Created comprehensive PLAN.md with 7-phase implementation strategy

- Build: Simple build.cmd batch script (may add CMake later)
- Dependencies: Windows SDK only (Advapi32, Shlwapi, User32, Gdi32)
- Code constraints: <20 lines per function, <200 lines per file
- Testing: Manual testing with sample fonts, no test framework
