See docs/STREAMLINING_PLAN.md for complete execution plan.

## Immediate: Quality & Robustness Improvements ✅ COMPLETE

All critical fixes implemented and tested (2025-11-02):

- ✅ **Fixed argv bounds checking in main.cpp** (MEDIUM severity)
  - Added `i + 1 < argc` checks at lines 66, 88-90, 114-116
  - Prevents crash with malformed CLI arguments

- ✅ **Added input validation for font file paths**
  - New IsValidFontPath() function in sys_utils.cpp/h
  - Validates paths don't contain `..\\` sequences
  - Applied to RemoveFontByName, UninstallFontByName

- ✅ **Improved error handling in InstallFont**
  - AddFontResourceExA failure now returns error
  - Automatic rollback: deletes registry entry + copied file
  - Ensures atomic operations

## Immediate: Additional Quality Improvements (Round 2) ✅ COMPLETE

Small refinements implemented (2025-11-02):

- ✅ **Added --version flag to CLI**
  - Shows version from embedded resource data
  - Supports both `--version` and `-v` flags
  - +31 lines in main.cpp

- ✅ **Improved error messages with actionable guidance**
  - Admin errors suggest "Run as administrator"
  - File errors suggest checking path
  - +7 "Solution:" lines in font_ops.cpp

- ✅ **Added build output validation to build.cmd**
  - Verifies fontlift.exe exists
  - Warns on suspicious file sizes
  - +17 lines in build.cmd

## Immediate: Code Refactoring (Round 4) ✅ COMPLETE

Code quality violations fixed (2025-11-02):

- ✅ **Refactored InstallFont() to 18 lines**
  - Was 79 lines, now 18 lines
  - Extracted 4 helper functions
  - ValidateInstallPrerequisites(), ExtractFontName(), RegisterAndLoadFont()

- ✅ **Refactored UninstallFontByName() to 17 lines**
  - Was 59 lines, now 17 lines
  - Extracted FindFontInRegistry(), UnloadAndCleanupFont()

- ✅ **Refactored RemoveFontByName() to 17 lines**
  - Was 67 lines, now 17 lines
  - Shares logic with UninstallFontByName via helpers

**Impact:**
- font_ops.cpp: 318 → 264 lines (-54 lines, -17%)
- Total codebase: 991 → 937 lines (-54 lines)
- All functions now ≤22 lines (2 helpers at 22, rest ≤18)
- Improved code readability and maintainability

## Immediate: Robustness Improvements (Round 3) ✅ COMPLETE

Additional quality improvements implemented (2025-11-02):

- ✅ **Add file size validation to font_parser.cpp**
  - Rejects files <100 bytes or >50MB (clearly corrupt/invalid)
  - Early validation before attempting to parse
  - Prevents crashes from malformed font files
  - +14 lines in font_parser.cpp (2 validation blocks)

- ✅ **Add Windows API error codes to error messages**
  - Includes GetLastError() codes with FormatMessage
  - Helps diagnose CopyFile, Registry, AddFontResource failures
  - New GetLastErrorMessage() helper in sys_utils
  - +18 lines in sys_utils.cpp, +3 lines in font_ops.cpp

- ✅ **Add duplicate installation detection**
  - Checks if font already registered before installing
  - Warns user with existing location
  - Proceeds with overwrite (avoids accidental duplicates)
  - +6 lines in font_ops.cpp InstallFont()

## Immediate: Code Quality Improvements (Round 5) ✅ COMPLETE

Code complexity violations fixed (2025-11-02):

- ✅ **Refactored main() to reduce complexity**
  - Was 136 lines, now 32 lines (-76% reduction)
  - Extracted 4 command handler functions
  - HandleVersionCommand(), HandleListCommand(), HandleInstallCommand(), HandleUninstallOrRemove()

- ✅ **Refactored GetFontName() in font_parser.cpp**
  - Was 33 lines, now 19 lines (-42% reduction)
  - Extracted ExtractFilenameWithoutExtension() helper
  - Cleaner fallback logic

- ✅ **Refactored IsValidFontPath() in sys_utils.cpp**
  - Was 30 lines, now 6 lines (-80% reduction)
  - Extracted HasPathTraversal() and IsAbsolutePathInFontsDir() helpers
  - Simplified validation logic

**Impact:**
- Total codebase: 937 → 904 lines (-33 lines, -3.5%)
- Functions >20 lines: 6 → 5 (main() was 136, now 32)
- Improved code readability and maintainability
- CI/CD passing (Run #18997732386)

## Immediate: Final Polish (Round 6)

Small but important quality improvements (2025-11-02):

- [ ] **Add `this_file` comments to all source files**
  - Currently missing from src/*.cpp and src/*.h files
  - Ensures file path tracking consistency with project standards
  - Add `// this_file: src/filename.cpp` near top of each file

- [ ] **Add const correctness to function parameters**
  - Review all function signatures in headers
  - Add `const` to parameters that shouldn't be modified
  - Improves type safety and compiler optimization

- [ ] **Refactor HandleVersionCommand() to reduce size**
  - Currently 23 lines (slightly over 20 line target)
  - Extract version extraction logic into helper function
  - Target: <20 lines

## Week 1: Documentation Cleanup

- [ ] Delete unnecessary MD files (9 files: CLAUDE.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, PRINCIPLES.md, WORK.md, TODO.md, PLAN.md, etc.)
- [ ] Delete templates/ directory
- [ ] Consolidate README to <150 lines
- [ ] Archive CHANGELOG (keep last 5 releases)
- [ ] Commit: "Aggressive documentation cleanup"

## Week 2: Chocolatey Package

- [ ] Create tools/chocolateyinstall.ps1
- [ ] Test locally: `choco pack && choco install fontlift -s . -y`
- [ ] Update .github/workflows/release.yml (add Chocolatey publish)
- [ ] Submit to https://community.chocolatey.org/
- [ ] Wait for approval (3-7 days)

## Week 3: WinGet Package

- [ ] Fork microsoft/winget-pkgs
- [ ] Create manifests/f/Fontlaborg/fontlift/VERSION/*.yaml (3 files)
- [ ] Validate: `winget validate manifests/f/Fontlaborg/fontlift/VERSION/`
- [ ] Test: `winget install --manifest manifests/f/Fontlaborg/fontlift/VERSION/`
- [ ] Submit PR to microsoft/winget-pkgs
- [ ] Wait for merge (1-3 days)

## Week 4: Verification
